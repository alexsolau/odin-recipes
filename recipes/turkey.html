    <h2>The Greatest Grilled Turkey</h2>
    <p>The better question is: "Why wouldn't you grill a turkey?" Not only does this method result in wonderfully crispy skin and a smoky flavor that you can't get from roasting alone, it frees up oven space on the big day â€” so you'll have plenty of room to cook as many side dishes as you want. </p>
